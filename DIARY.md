PyCharm is driving me crazy. I try to find a very very simple and newbee friendly
way to set up a new system. I can set up a new system (from the command line, from
PyCharm, forward or backward, day or night), but all ways I see are not really newbee
friendly.

I have a simple goal: I want a virtualenv which contains my zero21tree. But by default
PyCharm does it the other way round: It creates a virtualenv inside zero21tree. Grrr.

Today there is only one git repo, but in the future there could be several. 

I would like to have this directory layout: zero21env/src/zero21tree.
