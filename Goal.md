# Goal of Simple21Tree

Simple21Tree should be a Wiki which can be easily integrated into [Nextcloud](//nextcloud.com).

It should provide the usual "Term --> Content" mapping which Wikis provide.

Every term should automatically be a hashtag which can be used in different places (chat, markdown, ...).

This way it should be very easy to link between wiki pages and between chat messages and wiki pages.

Example:

Alice is new at Foo Company and she asks Bob in the chat:

Alice> Hi Bob, how are holiday request handled at Foo Company?

Bob> See #Vacation
