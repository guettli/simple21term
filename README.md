# Who owns what?

A simple way to align projects. From one man shows to startups to well-established companies.

* It is not ISO 9001:2015, since it is simple.
* It is not a Wiki, since it is structured.
* It fits your organization, since you shape it.

Who-owns-what helps you to define:

* the roles for your people. Fom CEO to the cleaning person
* the processes for these roles.
* the terminology for all stakeholders.

It is simple, that's why it is clear, fast and successfull.

Open Source since 2020.

## Terminology

* **Role**: This is a general beautiful tree. From CEO to cleaning person. This is the [Org Chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_chart)
* **Term**: This is a particular person, process or tool. It is a flat list.

* Create new project from Version Control: https://github.com/guettli/who-owns-what.git
* Open "manage.py". There should be a warning on the top "Configure Python Interpreter".
* Do it: Choose "New Environment".
* Wait some seconds. PyCharm is indexing.
* A yellow warning should be at the top of manage.py: "Package requirement is missing: Django>=....". Install it. Wait.
* Configure the runserver like explained here: [runnserver in PyCharm Community Edition](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27269574/how-to-run-debug-server-for-django-project-in-pycharm-community-edition)
* Run 'runserver'. `Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/` should be visible
* Open the URL of the development server in your browser. You should see "The install worked successfully! Congratulations!"
