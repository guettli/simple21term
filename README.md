# Who-owns-what?

A simple way to align projects. From one man shows to startups to well-established companies.

* It is not ISO 9001:2015, since it is simple.
* It is not a Wiki, since it is structured.
* It fits your organization, since you shape it.

Who-owns-what helps you to define:

* the roles for your people. Fom CEO to the cleaning person
* the processes for these roles.
* the terminology for all stakeholders.

It is simple, that's why it is clear, fast and successfull.

Open Source since 2020.

## Installation

* Create new project from Version Control: https://github.com/guettli/who-own-what.git
