# What-and-who-tree

A simple way to align startups and well-established companies.

* It is not ISO 9001:2015, since it is simple.
* It is not a Wiki, since it is structured.
* It fits your organization, since you shape it.

The what-and-who-tree helps you to define:

* the roles for your people. 
* the processes for these roles.
* the terminology for all stakeholders.

It is simple, that's why it is clear, fast and successfull.
